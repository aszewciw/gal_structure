Testing whether DD/MM - 1 converges to the correct parameter values if
I make a sample not in particular lines of sight (like SEGUE), but instead
in a spherical volume centered on the sun.

For now I'm thinking I'll make ~18,000 mock stars to mimic the size of the
SEGUE sample. For the random weighted sample...~50,000 stars?

This would be a good time to write a better correlation function because
mine is slow AF.

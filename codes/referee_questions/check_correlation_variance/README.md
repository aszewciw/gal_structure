Project Details are as follows:

1.  Choose a couple lines of sight (5?) that point in different directions in
    the galaxy.
2.  Make a mock. The mock will come in two varieties:
    i.  Make stars until we have the same number as are in the corresponding
        SEGUE l.o.s.
    ii. Do not stop assigning stars to a particular l.o.s. once that l.o.s. has
        the same number as are in SEGUE. Instead, keep filling EVERY l.o.s.
        until the hardest to populate l.o.s. has as many stars as are in SEGUE,
        or some other limiting amount (100 for example).
3.  Make a random sample. The random sample can come in several varietites:
    i.  10* as many stars as are in SEGUE l.o.s.
    ii. 10* as many stars as are in mock (depending on conditions above).
    iii.Each l.o.s. has the same number of stars (1000, 1500, 2000)
4.  Plot the correlation function for different combinations of mock and random
    samples. We likely will need some estimate of the error in order to
    determine what the natural spread in the correlation function is.

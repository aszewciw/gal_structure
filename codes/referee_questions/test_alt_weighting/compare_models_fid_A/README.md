# Compare the weighted random MM measurements to the truth from making many mocks

## Use different combinations of number of randoms and number of mocks used:
    * mocks:
        * 1000 mocks
        * 10000 mocks
    * randoms:
        * 10 times SEGUE
        * 100 times SEGUE
        * 1000 times SEGUE

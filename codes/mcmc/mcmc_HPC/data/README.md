Parent directory for data folders.

**Once I set up a proper data prepare folder, this will change.

Subfolders contain the following:

dd              = segue data pair counts
errors          = jackknife errors for randoms and data
mcmc_output     = data produced from mcmc
model_pairs     = pre-binned indices of random pairs
model_positions = positions of random/model points
raw             = raw segue data
